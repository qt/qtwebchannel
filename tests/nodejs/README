This is a small NodeJS implementation on how to connect to a QWebChannel.

It uses 'mocha' which is a testframework for nodejs. Of course this is not really
a valid test, because it does no checks, nor is it an automated test. 
The test just sends a message to the standalone chat example.

How to run it:

- Install NodeJS (at least 0.10.x) (http://www.nodejs.org/download/)
- go to tests/nodejs and execute "npm install". This sets up the nodeJS environment in this folder
- ensure examples/standalone/standalone is running
- execute the tests with "mocha test.js"
- check (manually) if the chat dialog  received the message
