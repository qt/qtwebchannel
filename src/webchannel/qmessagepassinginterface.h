    \brief The interface used for communication between the QWebChannel server and its HTML clients.

    In order to communicate with HTML clients an object implementing this interface must be passed
    to QWebChannel::connectTo(). Currently this interface is implemented by QWebSocket for pure C++
    applications. QML applications can use the declarative WebSocket or WebView.experimental's
    \c navigator.qt functionality.
