    \brief The identifier under which an object, registered to a WebChannel, is known to remote clients.

    This property must be set for every object that should be published over the WebChannel.
    While no restrictions are enforced on the format of the id, it is usually a good idea to
    choose a string that is also a valid JavaScript identifier.
