    \class QWebChannel

    \inmodule QtWebChannel
    \brief Expose QObjects to remote HTML clients.
    \since 5.4

    The QWebChannel fills the gap between C++ applications and HTML/JavaScript
    applications. By publishing a QObject derived object to a QWebChannel and
    using \l{qtwebchannel-javascript.html}{\c qwebchannel.js} on the HTML side, one can transparently access
    properties and public slots and methods of the QObject. No manual message
    passing and serialization of data is required, property updates and signal emission
    on the C++ side get automatically transmitted to the potentially remotely running HTML clients.
    There a JavaScript object for any published C++ QObject is available with an intuitive API
    mirrored after the C++ object's API.

    The C++ QWebChannel API makes it possible to talk to any HTML client, which could run on a local
    or even remote machine. The only limitation is that the HTML client supports the JavaScript
    features used by \l{qtwebchannel-javascript.html}{\c qwebchannel.js}. As such, one can interact
    with basically any modern HTML browser or standalone JavaScript runtime, such as node.js.

    There also exists a declarative WebChannel API.
