    \title Qt WebChannel
    \brief Bridges the gap between C++/QML and HTML/JavaScript.

    The QtWebChannel module implements a channel for seamless interaction between
    C++/QML applications and HTML/JavaScript clients. Instances of QObject inheriting classes
    can be published and then seamlessly used from both sides.

    For more information, read the documentation of either the C++ QWebChannel or the QML WebChannel.
    In addition the \l{qtwebchannel-examples.html}{examples} show how to use this module.
