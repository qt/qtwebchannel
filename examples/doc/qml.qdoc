    \title QML Example
    \ingroup qtwebchannel-examples
    \brief Shows how to use the QWebChannel API to communicate with a WebView HTML client.

    The QML example is a simple chat between a QML server and a HTML client running in a WebView.

    The QML side exports a server object with a minimal send/receive API over the webchannel.
    The server emits the send signal when the user sents a message from the QML side. The signal
    automatically gets propagated to the HTML client. When the user enters a message on the HTML
    side, server.receive is invoked on the QML side.
